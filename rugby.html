            Brute strength, speed, agility and tactical thinking are all elements associated with this full-body, contact sport played by nations around the world. <br> Rugby, which is a variation on football, has been around since the 19th century. <br> The 15-side team attempts to breach the opposing team’s defensive line and score a try in their in-goal area. The game is played with ball-in-hand and by kicking the ball. <br> Passing between players is permitted provided it is thrown sideways or backwards. <br>A rugby game lasts 80 minutes, which is split into two halves of 40 minutes. <br> A rugby team is made up of 15 players in some of the following positions: loose-head prop, hooker, tight-head prop, second-row lock, flanker, scrumhalf, flyhalf, left-wing, inside centre, outside centre, right-wing and fullback.
